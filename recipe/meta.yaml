# [1] notes on windows builds (28 oct 2025):
#     - There is a known bug affecting `1.15 <= scipy < 1.15.3` on windows.
#       See https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/22558
#       We make sure to exclude these scipy versions explicitly
#     - There are unknown bugs somewhere in scipy/numpy, probably the underlying MKL that cause
#       our tests to fail (lanczos does not converge, np.linalg.eigh raises not converged), only
#       on numpy and only for python 3.10 and 3.11 (<3.10 not tested, end of life).
#       This could probably be resolved by carefully excluding package versions, but I dont have
#       capacity to diagnose which versions cause the problems, and I want to publish for 3.14 ASAP

  summary: Simulation of quantum many-body systems with tensor networks in Python
  description: |
    "TeNPy is a package of Python code for the simulation of quantum many-body systems with tensor networks.
    Amongst others, it includes codes for the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm
    and the time evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm based on matrix product states (MPS).
    The minimal dependency is Python, Numpy and Scipy, but it ships with an optional Cython extension to
    reduce the Python overhead in tensor contractions."
